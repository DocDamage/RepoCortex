# Release Certification Checklist

> Workstream 8: v1.0 Certification and Release Discipline  
> Version: 1.0.0  
> Status: Use this checklist for every release candidate

This checklist must be completed and signed off before a release candidate can be promoted to a stable v1.0 tag. Each item has a **Check** (what to verify), **Owner** (who is accountable), **Evidence** (where to look), and **Status** (`Pending` / `Pass` / `Fail` / `N/A`).

1. Copy this file and rename it to `RELEASE_CERTIFICATION_CHECKLIST_v<version>_<candidate>.md`.
2. Fill in the `Status` column for every row.
3. Attach the JSON report from `scripts/Invoke-ReleaseCertification.ps1` as supporting evidence.
4. Any `Fail` blocks promotion.
