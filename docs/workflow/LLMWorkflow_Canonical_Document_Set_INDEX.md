## Purpose of Part 4

Part 4 is the canonical place for **new repo intake decisions** that do **not** belong inside the currently active worked-example packs (`rpgmaker-mz`, `godot-engine`, `blender-engine`).

It exists so that:
- repo names are preserved
- future pack ideas stay concrete
- the core pack specs do not get polluted with unrelated sources
- candidate packs can be promoted later without losing evaluation history

## Purpose of Appendage A

Appendage A is the canonical add-on for **expanded Godot pack source intake** that is specific enough to matter operationally, but not yet merged into Part 3.

It exists so that:
- new Godot repos are preserved by name
- Godot-specific routing, extraction, and authority rules stay concrete
- the active Godot pack can grow without forcing a risky rewrite of Part 3 every pass
- approved appendage material can later be promoted into the main Godot section once stabilized

## Canonical editing rule

- Edit **Part 1â€“3** only when changing active architecture or active pack specs.
- Edit **Part 4** when evaluating new repos, future packs, or intake candidates outside the active worked-example packs.
- Edit **Appendage A** when expanding the Godot repo candidate set, routing rules, extraction targets, or evaluation tasks before those changes are promoted into Part 3.
- When candidate or appendage material becomes fully adopted, move it into the appropriate active part and mark the source entry as promoted/superseded.

## Candidate status meanings

- **Adopt now** â€” strong enough to add to the future-pack intake registry immediately
- **Conditional** â€” useful, but only if that domain becomes an actual toolkit target
- **Hold / Skip** â€” not worth adding now, duplicate, too educational, too stale, or wrong layer

## Current note

**All Phases Complete (1-7):** The platform now supports 10 domain packs with 220 PowerShell Modules and 800+ functions. MCP integration is fully deployed with `godot-mcp` and `blender-mcp` servers operational. Inter-pack pipelines are active for Blenderâ†’Godot, AI generation workflows, voice animation pipelines, and ML deployment chains.

**Appendage A Complete:** All 15 extended Godot sources have been integrated into the godot-engine pack, bringing the total to 43 sources. This includes testing frameworks (gdUnit4), AI behavior systems (LimboAI, FSM), dialogue systems (Dialogic, DialogueQuest), quest/inventory systems, rollback networking, editor VCS, signal visualization, save systems, RPG data frameworks (Pandora), chunk streaming (chunx), alternate voxel terrain, and platform-service integration.

**Phase 5 & 6 Complete:** Retrieval, answer integrity, human trust, and governance modules are now fully implemented. The platform now supports:
- Query routing with 7 retrieval profiles
- Cross-pack arbitration with dispute resolution
- Answer planning and traceability
- Confidence-based abstain/escalation policies
- Caveat registry with known falsehoods
- Human annotations and project overrides
- Golden task evaluation framework
- Replay harness for regression testing
- Pack SLOs and telemetry tracking
- Human review gates for sensitive operations

**Phase 7 Complete:** MCP-native toolkit servers and inter-pack pipelines are operational:
- MCP toolkit server deployment (`godot-mcp`, `blender-mcp`)
- Composite gateway for multi-tool orchestration
- Inter-pack transport with provenance preservation
- Snapshot management and rollback across packs
