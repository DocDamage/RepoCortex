## Current Baseline Truth

The branch baseline is broader than older summaries that only listed a handful of named suite counts.

### Baseline currently exercised
- full `tests/` execution through `tools/ci/invoke-pester-safe.ps1`
- Windows CI matrix across `powershell` and `pwsh`
- Linux/macOS experimental Pester lanes
- install/bootstrap smoke
- docs-truth validation
- compatibility-lock validation
- template drift validation
- ContextLattice integration lane

### Why the older wording was stale
Older tracker wording implied the baseline was just a few targeted suite checkpoints. That is no longer the right source of truth for the branch. The repo now treats the broader CI/test envelope above as the real baseline.

## Documented Head Work

The stable version line remains `0.9.6`, but the branch head is in active post-0.9.6 hardening.

Documented head work includes:
- engine-aware game asset manifest scaffolding
- asset scan classification and metadata preservation
- Unreal descriptor extraction for `.uplugin` and `.uproject`
- RPG Maker asset catalog parsing for `img/*`, `audio/*`, and `js/plugins`
- resolver hardening around provider selection, alias env vars, override fallback, and base URL precedence
- curated-plugin compatibility fixtures with richer active/deprecated/quarantined/retired/mixed-state coverage

Strategic emphasis has shifted from raw expansion toward:
- release-state reconciliation
- observability and policy hardening
- mixed-artifact and game-asset ingestion quality
- clearer boundaries between inventory support, descriptor parsing, and deeper extraction

## Post-0.9.6 Remediation Update (2026-04-14)

### Completed In This Remediation Wave
- CI portability hardened with `tools/ci/invoke-pester-safe.ps1` and workflow wiring
- docs/release path drift reduced across release criteria, certification, and canonical index docs
- stale install-script references removed from CI/docs in favor of direct module import
- `RunId` script invocation behavior fixed to support `-Command` usage safely
- pack module behavior stabilized for PowerShell 5.1 and return-shape consistency
- benchmark and pack/framework harnesses aligned to current module behavior
- provider resolver hardening completed and covered in `tests/LLMWorkflow.Tests.ps1`
- curated-plugin compatibility behavior scenarios added to the compatibility fixture suites
- **6 new Primitive test suites** (AtomicWrite, CommandContract, FileLock, Journal, StateFile, Workspace) fixed for Pester v5 and PowerShell 5.1 compatibility
- **.NET File.Move 3-arg overload bug** fixed in StateFile, Logging, and SnapshotManager for PS 5.1
- **ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable** replaced with PS 5.1-compatible conversion in StateFile
- **CorrelationId parameter block parse errors** fixed across retrieval and MCP modules
- **docs-truth validator** restored to green (README.md metrics synchronized)
- **DoclingAdapter failure-visibility hardening**: removed silent command/path probes and added explicit suppressed-exception diagnostics with regression tests
- **GeometryNodesParser file-probe hardening**: removed `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` path probing, added explicit file-resolution failure signaling, and added dedicated parser tests (`tests/GeometryNodesParser.Tests.ps1`)
- **HealFunctions reliability hardening**: removed silent path/command/file probes, added explicit helper-based diagnostics, made force mode truly non-interactive, and fixed strict-mode/count regressions with passing `tests/LLMWorkflow.HealFunctions.Tests.ps1`
- **DashboardViews probe hardening**: removed silent command/file enumeration probes, added explicit helper-based diagnostics, fixed case-insensitive duplicate-key parsing defects, and added dedicated resilience tests (`tests/DashboardViews.Tests.ps1`)
- **LLMWorkflow.Dashboard runtime hardening**: removed silent command probes for `python`/`codemunch-pro`, replaced unsupported inline status-expression usage with PowerShell 5.1-safe status logic, and made script execution dot-source safe for tests with dedicated coverage (`tests/LLMWorkflow.Dashboard.Tests.ps1`)
- **LLMWorkflow.Dashboard status consistency hardening**: centralized warning-vs-failure classification so interactive output, non-interactive report text, and exit-code fail detection stay aligned (including missing-context connectivity checks).

### Resolver Hardening Completed
The current branch baseline already covers:
- provider profile mapping for `openai`, `claude`, `kimi`, `gemini`, `glm`, and `ollama`
- auto-detection priority order
- invalid `LLM_PROVIDER` override fallback
- alias environment variable handling (`MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `ZHIPU_API_KEY`)
- base URL fallback and precedence handling including `OLLAMA_HOST` / `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
- explicit-request behavior and key-validation edge cases

### Current Validation Posture
Use the CI baseline above as the authoritative validation posture. Legacy named suite counts may still be useful as spot checks, but they are no longer the whole story.

## Post-0.9.6 Final Release Hardening (2026-05-04)

### Completed In This Final Hardening Wave
- **Full Release Certification Pass (12/12)**: Achieved a 100% pass rate on the [v1.0 Release Certification Suite](../../scripts/Invoke-ReleaseCertification.ps1), covering all categories including Documentation Truth, Security Baseline, Retrieval Backend, and Module Contracts.
- **Retrieval Realism Implementation**: Replaced mock-backed retrieval adapters with real `Invoke-RestMethod` logic for Qdrant (REST) and functional local file-based storage for LanceDB.
- **Module Contract Remediation**: Resolved critical release blocker where palace management commands (`Test-LLMWorkflowPalace`, `Sync-LLMWorkflowPalace`) were documented but not exported in `LLMWorkflow.psd1`.
- **MemPalace Bridge Stability**: Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'errno'` in the MemPalace-to-ContextLattice bridge by properly importing the `errno` module in the Python sidecar.
- **Provider Support Consistency**: Standardized `ValidateSet` and resolver logic across `bootstrap`, `doctor`, and the core module to consistently support `claude` and `ollama` alongside legacy providers.
- **Container Runtime Hardening**: Verified that `docker-compose.yml` correctly requires external `CONTEXTLATTICE_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` configuration, eliminating "silent failure" defaults for the orchestrator endpoint.
- **Release Truth Reconciliation**: Updated `README.md`, `RELEASE_STATE.md`, and `task_progress.json` to reflect **v1.0 Release Candidate** status.

---

## Next Steps (Hardening Backlog)

Highest-priority remaining work:
1. Maintain 100% pass rate on `Invoke-ReleaseCertification.ps1`
2. Finalize version bump to `v1.0.0` across all files
3. Complete final merge to `main` and tag the release
4. Transition to operational maintenance and feature-driven expansion

Operational maintenance:
- keep the full CI/test baseline green
- monitor golden task and compatibility regressions
- maintain parser quality and provenance consistency
