## Summary

The repo is no longer blocked by missing core capability.
It is blocked by the quality gap between what the platform can do and how consistently, observably, and safely it does it.

Recent remediation already improved important areas:
- explicit module exports replaced wildcard export behavior
- subsystem fork consolidation reduced parallel implementations and loader ambiguity
- CI-safe Pester invocation improved release-test portability
- docs and release truth alignment improved materially
- mixed artifact and game-asset ingestion foundations now exist with real tests

That progress matters.
It also changes the audit posture.
The main question is no longer whether the platform is broad enough.
The main question is whether it is disciplined enough for `v1.0`.

## Current Audit Read

The highest remaining debt is now concentrated in six release-priority areas:
1. failure visibility and unsafe execution patterns
2. structural refactoring and canonical ownership
3. module contracts and PowerShell hygiene
4. release-gate test and evidence coverage
5. mixed artifact and game-asset ingestion consistency
6. security, portability, and promotion discipline

This ordering is intentionally aligned with `REMAINING_WORK.md` and the strategic plan.

## Release Priorities

### Priority 0: Failure Visibility and Unsafe Execution

This is the most important open debt cluster.
A feature-rich repo is still not release-ready if failures disappear into suppressed errors, empty catches, or UI-only logging.

#### Current Signal
- `219` uses of `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` were flagged in the detailed audit
- empty catch blocks remain in `GoldenTasks.ps1`, `GeometryNodesParser.ps1`, `DoclingAdapter.ps1`, and `ExternalIngestion.ps1`
- `Invoke-Expression` usage was flagged in audit-related security paths
- `Write-Host` concentration remains high in several reusable modules

#### Why It Matters
- silent failure undermines operator trust and test signal
- swallowed exceptions make regressions harder to diagnose than they should be
- non-pipeline-safe output patterns reduce composability and automation reliability

#### Current Recommendation
- treat failure visibility as a release gate, not as optional cleanup

### Priority 1: Structural Refactoring and Canonical Ownership

Large files and helper duplication remain one of the biggest maintainability risks in the repo.
This is especially important now that the platform is still expanding in ingestion and governance areas.

#### Current Signal
- `58` files were flagged over `1000` lines in the detailed audit
- high-pressure modules include `MLModelDeploymentPipeline.ps1`, `ExternalIngestion.ps1`, `AIGenerationPipeline.ps1`, `GoldenTasks.ps1`, `ExtractionPipeline.ps1`, and `LLMWorkflow.GameFunctions.ps1`
- duplicate helper names still show where canonical utility boundaries need more tightening, even after subsystem consolidation

#### Why It Matters
- review and test radius stay larger than they need to be
- ownership boundaries remain harder to reason about
- new features can inherit old structure problems unless the layout is improved deliberately

#### Current Recommendation
- refactor the largest high-change modules first and remove duplicate helper drift as part of that work

### Priority 2: Module Contracts and PowerShell Hygiene

This is broad but necessary debt.
The repo should look and behave like an intentional module ecosystem rather than a collection of inherited scripts.

#### Current Signal
- many modules still lack `Set-StrictMode`
- help and contract gaps remain around `[CmdletBinding()]`, `.SYNOPSIS`, and `[OutputType()]`
- unapproved verb usage still appears across several modules
- newer ingestion surfaces such as `UnrealDescriptorParser.ps1` and `RPGMakerAssetCatalogParser.ps1` are valuable additions, but they still need the same contract discipline as older modules

#### Why It Matters
- weak contracts slow onboarding and increase ambiguity
- strict mode gaps allow avoidable defects to survive longer
- help gaps make the public surface less self-documenting than it should be

#### Current Recommendation
- prioritize contract hygiene on high-value public surfaces and on newly added parser modules before drift compounds further

### Priority 3: Release-Gate Testing and Evidence Coverage

Test portability improved, but coverage is still uneven around core primitives and release-risk behavior.

#### Current Signal
- foundational modules such as `AtomicWrite.ps1`, `CommandContract.ps1`, `FileLock.ps1`, `Journal.ps1`, `StateFile.ps1`, `TypeConverters.ps1`, and `Workspace.ps1` still belong in the test-hardening queue
- module export and loader boundaries need stronger negative and regression coverage
- newer asset-ingestion work is doing better here than much of the historical codebase, which is a good pattern to extend

#### Why It Matters
- `v1.0` confidence depends on whether CI reflects real risk, not just whether a subset of suites are green

#### Current Recommendation
- convert foundational behavior and loader boundaries into explicit release-gate coverage

### Priority 4: Mixed Artifact and Game Asset Ingestion Consistency

This is now a real platform capability and therefore a real governance responsibility.

#### Current Signal
- engine-aware asset manifests and preset scaffolding are in place
- Unreal descriptor extraction is in place for `.uplugin` and `.uproject`
- RPG Maker asset catalog parsing is in place for common families and plugin metadata
- the next risks are provenance normalization, contract quality, parser integration discipline, and honest scope boundaries between inventory and deep extraction

#### Why It Matters
- the repo now handles more than text and code
- downstream governance, retrieval, and cataloging depend on output consistency across these newer surfaces

#### Current Recommendation
- keep shipping asset-ingestion capability, but only with tests, provenance clarity, and clear scope language

### Priority 5: Security, Portability, and Promotion Discipline

Security and release evidence exist, but they still need to become unavoidable rather than aspirational.

#### Current Signal
- heuristic secret matches still require manual triage
- hardcoded absolute path findings still exist in some production-adjacent and tooling scripts
- release promotion should require current security evidence and clearer portability assumptions

#### Why It Matters
- a `v1.0` release should not depend on local-path luck or optional security review habits

#### Current Recommendation
- turn the remaining heuristic warnings into triaged outcomes and make promotion evidence part of normal release flow

## What Is Already Resolved Enough to Stop Re-Litigating

The following items should no longer be treated as open top-tier blockers unless new evidence appears:
- wildcard module export behavior as the default shipped contract
- parallel subsystem forks as the primary architecture problem
- primary CI-safe Pester portability for core release suites
- obvious release-path drift around earlier changelog and workflow references

These are not reasons to stop auditing.
They are reasons to focus the next hardening wave on the debt that is still materially open.

---

## Recommended Remediation Order

1. clear failure-visibility issues first
2. decompose the largest high-risk modules and reduce duplicate helper drift
3. harden strict mode, function contracts, and public help surfaces
4. convert foundational runtime behavior into explicit release-gate tests
5. keep docs and release truth aligned as head changes
6. deepen observability and policy on the critical path
7. harden mixed artifact and game-asset ingestion consistency and provenance
8. make security evidence, portability discipline, durable execution, and MCP governance part of normal release expectations

This is the same order now used across the planning docs.

## Verification Basis

This audit summary is based on:
- the detailed working audit in `../../deep_audit_results.txt`
- current implementation-planning documents under `docs/implementation/`
- recent loader, test, and documentation remediation already landed at head
- current module and parser additions related to mixed artifact and game-asset ingestion
